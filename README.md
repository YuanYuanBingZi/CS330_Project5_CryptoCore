# CS330_Project5_CryptoCore
CryptoCore is a comprehensive project implementing classic encryption algorithms like Substitution, Caesar, ROT13, Running Key, and Vigen√®re ciphers. Using object-oriented principles, it provides modular encryption/decryption methods with a focus on inheritance, polymorphism, and robust error handling.
